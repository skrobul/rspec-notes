# Effective Testing with RSpec 3

#### A good test should provide:
* Design Guidance
* Safety Net
* Documentation

#### What to test first?

* Ask yourself: "whats the core of the project?"
 
####Â Good Habits

* Describe precisely what you want the program to do in order to avoid being to strict or lax.
* Write specs to report failure at the right level of detail.
* Give the right detail to find the cause of the problem without drowning in excessive output.
* Clearly separate noisy setup code from essential test code.
* Reorder, profile, and filter specs to unearth dependencies.
